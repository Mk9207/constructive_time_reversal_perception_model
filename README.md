# Constructive Time Reversal Perception Model
This repository presents a constructivist framework for modeling time-reversal cognitive mechanisms, proposing a formal theory applicable to predictive perception and retrocausal inference.

## Overview
- **Theory**: Constructive modeling of reverse-time perceptual pathways
- **Applications**: Temporal AI systems, time-sensitive sensory feedback, retrocausal prediction
- **Structure**: Formal definitions, lemmas, and implementation concepts in `sections/`
